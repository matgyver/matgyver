# Matthew Nelson Profile ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile page. I am a professor at Iowa State Univeristy in the Aerospace Engineering department. Although I teach in Aerospace Engineering, my background is in Electrical and Computer Engineering and my PhD work is in Human Computer Interactions. Specifically, I look at engineering education and how we can use computers, games and other technology to teach engineering students. 

In addition to my teaching and research, I am the Director for the Make to Innovate (M:2:I) program (https://m2i.aere.iastate.edu) and I am also the Assistant Director for the Iowa Space Grant Consortium (ISGC) (https://iaspacegrant.org). Make to Innovate is a hands on program where students work on projects and apply the engineering skills they have learned on hands on projects and in the process learn new skills. ISGC is a program taht receives funding from NASA to help promote NASA and STEM activities in Iowa by working with the universities, colleges, industry and government affilates in the state of Iowa.
